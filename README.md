# Plant Disease Prediction using SVM (A Flask Web Project)

This is a Flask Web project to detect Plant diseases. I have implemented 9 types of Plant's Diseases here. Each Plant has several Disease classes. There's also an AI chatbot implemented here to help users get responses about any kind of diseases related query.
